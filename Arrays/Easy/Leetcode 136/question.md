# [Leetcode 136: Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/description/)

---

## 📘 Description

Given a **non-empty** array of integers `nums`, every element appears **twice** except for **one**. Find that single one.

> ⚡ You must implement a solution with **linear runtime complexity** and use only **constant extra space**.

---

## 🧪 Examples

### Example 1:
Input: `nums = [2,2,1]`  
Output: `1`

---

### Example 2:
Input: `nums = [4,1,2,1,2]`  
Output: `4`

---

### Example 3:
Input: `nums = [1]`  
Output: `1`

---

## 🧾 Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10⁴`
- `-3 * 10⁴ <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10⁴`
- Each element in the array appears **twice** except for **one** element which appears **only once**
