# [Leetcode 268: Missing Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/missing-number/description/)

---

## 📘 Description

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the **only** number in the range that is **missing** from the array.

---

## 🧪 Examples

### Example 1:
Input: `nums = [3,0,1]`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation:  
`n = 3` → so range = `[0,3]`.  
`2` is missing from the array.

---

### Example 2:
Input: `nums = [0,1]`  
Output: `2`  
Explanation:  
`n = 2` → range = `[0,2]`.  
`2` is missing from the array.

---

### Example 3:
Input: `nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]`  
Output: `8`  
Explanation:  
`n = 9` → range = `[0,9]`.  
`8` is not present in the array.

---

## 🧾 Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10⁴`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the numbers of `nums` are **unique**

---

## 💡 Follow Up

Can you implement a solution using only **O(1)** extra space complexity and **O(n)** runtime complexity?
