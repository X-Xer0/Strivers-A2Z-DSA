## 📘 Description

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the **majority element**.

The majority element is the element that appears **more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times**.  
You may assume that the majority element **always exists** in the array.

## 🧪 Examples

### Example 1:
Input: `nums = [3,2,3]`  
Output: `3`

---

### Example 2:
Input: `nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]`  
Output: `2`

---

## 🧾 Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10⁴`
- `-10⁹ <= nums[i] <= 10⁹`
