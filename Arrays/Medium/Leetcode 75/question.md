# [Leetcode 75: Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/description/)

---

## 📘 Description

Given an array `nums` with `n` objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order: red, white, and blue.

We use the integers `0`, `1`, and `2` to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.

You **must not** use the library's sort function.

## 🧪 Examples

### Example 1:
Input: `nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]`  
Output: `[0,0,1,1,2,2]`

---

### Example 2:
Input: `nums = [2,0,1]`  
Output: `[0,1,2]`

---

## 🧾 Constraints

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 300`
- `nums[i]` is either `0`, `1`, or `2`.

## 💡 Follow Up

Can you come up with a **one-pass** algorithm using **only constant extra space**?

(Hint: Dutch National Flag Algorithm 🇳🇱)
